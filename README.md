# Happy
My first project done in Next Level Week - by Rocketseat

This project was done to help the people find orphanages to visits


It used HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the Front-End

And to the Back-End was used SQLite.

I learned a lot with this project.


## The Project
#### Home Page

![Home Page](https://github.com/GuilhermeZaninPs/Happy/blob/main/images/InitialPage.png)

In Home Page have a single botton that redirects to the page where the orphanages are registered.


#### Orphanages Registered

![Orphanages Registered](https://github.com/GuilhermeZaninPs/Happy/blob/main/images/FindOrphanage.png)

This page show every orphanages saved and your location.
If you want, it's possible to click in orphanage chosen and view all informations of the orphanage.
Or, you can to click in the botton to redirect to page where are possible save more orphanages.

#### Informations of the Orphanage

In the page Informations of the Orphanage, you can view the Name, WhatsApp number, Instructions to the visits, Images gallery,  Visit hours or get in touch and more.

#### Save new Orphanage

To the save a new orphanage, you need add location, name, number, some image, few some instructions and visit hours.
